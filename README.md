# My Python examples

Here is some more detailed information about the scripts I have written (If script is not mine I point it out on the 1st line of code) I make these small programs as experiments to have a play with the language, or to solve a problem.  I would gladly accept some piece of advice from others to improve the code and make it more efficient.  

- `sea_battleship.py` - Command line game using concepts of OOP. You can play with a computer. 
- `question_game.py` - Command line game using concepts of functions and condtion statements.
