# My Python scripts

I make these small programs as experiments to have a play with the language, moduls, or to solve a problem. I didn't use OOP or other fancy stuff for such a little scripts. The primary goal of this scripts is just to achieve a certain goal, like making a backup of a folder or check broken web links. In a script name and a header more detailed information. I would gladly accept some piece of advice from others to improve the code and make it more efficient.
