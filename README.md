# My Python scripts

I've written these small programs as experiments while playing with the language, modules, or to solve a problem. I didn't use OOP or other fancy stuff for such little scripts. 

The primary objective of this scripts is just to achieve a certain goal, like making a backup of a folder or check broken web links. 

In a script's name and in a header more detailed information.

I would gladly accept some piece of advice from others to improve the code and make it more efficient!
